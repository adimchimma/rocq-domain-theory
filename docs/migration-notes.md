# Migration Notes: Benton-Kennedy-Varming (2009) → rocq-domain-theory

This document compares, section by section, the domain theory
formalization described in Benton, Kennedy & Varming's paper *"Some
Domain Theory and Denotational Semantics in Coq"* (2009) with the
current `rocq-domain-theory` library.

**Important caveat.** We compare against BKV's *paper description*,
not their Coq artifact (which we do not have access to). Where BKV
describe a construction or proof strategy in prose, we note what they
describe; where they show Coq code in the paper, we cite it. We do
not speculate about implementation details the paper omits.

## Domain Theory Layer

---

### Orders and CPOs (BKV §2)

**BKV describe:** A `preorder` record with fields `carrier`, `le`,
`le_refl`, `le_trans`. CPOs are preorders equipped with least upper
bounds of chains (`lub_of_chain`, `lub_upper`, `lub_least`). Pointed
CPOs add a least element. BKV do not require antisymmetry at the
preorder/CPO level — they note this is standard.

**rocq-domain-theory:** HB hierarchy with explicit mixins:
```
HasLe → IsPreorder → Preorder
              └── IsPartialOrder → PartialOrder

HasSup + PartialOrder → IsCPO → CPO
HasBot + CPO → IsPointed → PointedCPO
```

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `Record preorder` with explicit `carrier` | `Preorder.type` with HB sort coercion | No `.carrier` projections needed |
| CPO on preorder | CPO requires `PartialOrder` | A&J Def. 2.1.13; `sup_ext` needs `le_antisym` |
| `Class Pointed` (typeclass) | `HasBottom` + `IsPointed` HB mixins | Avoids instance search surprises |
| `lub_of_chain` | `sup` (notation `⊔ c`) | |
| `lub_upper` / `lub_least` | `sup_upper` / `sup_least` | |
| Setoid equality `==` for CPO elements | Leibniz `=` | See DD-004 |

**Key semantic difference:** BKV build CPOs on preorders. We require
`PartialOrder` (antisymmetry). This follows A&J Definition 2.1.13 more
faithfully and is needed for `sup_ext` (equal chains have equal sups).
BKV's approach would require carrying `le_antisym` as a side condition
wherever `sup_ext` is used.

**What we add beyond BKV:**
- `OrderTheory.v`: setoid reasoning via `pequiv` (`x ≈ y`)
- `CPOTheory.v`: derived lemmas (`sup_mono`, `sup_ext`, `map_chain_id`)

---

### Continuous Functions (BKV §2)

**BKV describe:** Monotone functions (`mono_fun`) and continuous
functions (`cont_fun`, called `fconti` in the paper) as bundled records.
Composition is associative; identity is continuous. BKV use a separate
`Continuous` module.

**rocq-domain-theory:** Same approach — `mono_fun` and `cont_fun` as
bundled records in `Morphisms.v`. `continuous` is a predicate in `CPO.v`.

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `fconti` record (§2.1) | `cont_fun` record | Different name |
| `cf_mfun` field (mono_fun inside cont_fun) | `cf_mono` | Renamed |
| Separate `Continuous` module | `continuous` predicate in `CPO.v`, `cont_fun` in `Morphisms.v` | Consolidated |
| `cont_comp_assoc` via `proof_irrelevance` | Same strategy | `proof_irrelevance` still used |
| `g ∘ f` notation | Preserved | |

We also define `strict_fun` (strict = continuous + bottom-preserving),
which BKV do not discuss as a separate concept.

---

### Lift Monad (BKV §2.2)

**BKV describe:** A coinductive `delay D` type with constructors
`Eps` (delay step) and `Val` (result). The order is defined
coinductively, and the monad operations (`eta`/`ret`, `bind`/`kleisli`)
are corecursive. BKV describe bisimulation as the appropriate notion of
equality and use setoid equality throughout. They note the Kleisli
extension is the key construction for the monad structure.

**rocq-domain-theory:** We use the flat lift `option D` (`None` = ⊥,
`Some d` = value) instead of coinduction. See DD-006 for the full
rationale.

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Coinductive `delay D` | `option D` | Flat lift; see DD-006 |
| `Eps`/`Val` constructors | `None`/`Some` | |
| Coinductive order + bisimulation | Flat order: `None ⊑ x` always, `Some a ⊑ Some b ↔ a ⊑ b` | |
| Setoid equality (bisimulation) | Leibniz `=` | |
| Sup described abstractly | Proved via `ClassicalEpsilon` | 647 lines in `theory/Lift.v` |
| `eta`/`bind` corecursive | `ret`/`kleisli` on `option` | Direct pattern matching |
| Monad laws up to bisimulation | Monad laws up to Leibniz `=` | Simpler proofs |

**Why not coinduction?** The coinductive `delay D` type has a
fundamental antisymmetry obstruction: `now d ≠ later (now d)` (by
`discriminate`) but they are semantically equivalent (both converge to
`d`). Making `delay D` into a `CPO.type` (which uses Leibniz equality)
would require quotienting by bisimulation — requiring either setoid
CPOs, quotient types, or HITs. The flat lift avoids this entirely.

**Supplementary file:** `theory/LiftMonad.v` (488 lines) develops the
coinductive approach fully and proves precisely why it cannot form a
`CPO.type` without quotient types. This serves as a side-by-side
comparison with BKV's approach for the thesis.

---

### Function Spaces (BKV §2.1)

**BKV describe:** The function-space CPO `[D →c E]` with pointwise
order. BKV describe the pointwise sup construction `λ x. ⊔_n (c_n x)`
and note it is continuous, but the paper does not give a detailed proof
of the continuity of the pointwise sup.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `theory/FunctionSpaces.v` (882 lines) proves
the full construction:

1. The pointwise sup of continuous functions is well-defined.
2. The pointwise sup is itself continuous (the key lemma, using
   Scott-continuity of each function in the chain and commutativity of
   the double sup).
3. `curry`, `uncurry`, `eval` are proved continuous.
4. `FIXP : [[D →c D] →c D]` — the Kleene fixed-point operator packaged
   as a Scott-continuous map. BKV describe `FIXP` (§2.1) but the
   continuity proof (in `f`) is our contribution.

---

### Fixed Points (BKV §2.1)

**BKV describe:** The Kleene chain `⊥, f(⊥), f²(⊥), ...`, the
least fixed point `fixp f = ⊔ kleene_chain f`, the fixed-point property
`f(fixp f) = fixp f`, minimality, and Scott induction (`fixp_ind`) for
admissible predicates. BKV also describe `FIXP` as a continuous operator.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `theory/FixedPoints.v` (525 lines) proves all
of the above:

| BKV description | Our implementation |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| `iter f n` (n-th iterate) | `iter f n` |
| Kleene chain | `kleene_chain f` |
| `fixp f = ⊔ kleene_chain f` | Same |
| `f (fixp f) = fixp f` | `fixp_is_fixedpoint` |
| Least pre-fixed point | `fixp_least` |
| `fixp_ind` (admissible predicates) | `fixp_ind` |
| `FIXP` continuous in `f` | `FIXP` in `FunctionSpaces.v` (see above) |

---

### Products and Sums (BKV §2)

**BKV describe:** Binary products with pointwise order and componentwise
sups. Separated sums. The paper notes these constructions exist but does
not discuss the sum-sup construction in detail.

**rocq-domain-theory:**

- `theory/Products.v` (537 lines): Full proof-mode construction building
  up from `prod_le_refl` through HB instance registration. Continuous
  projections `π₁`/`π₂`, continuous pairing, `cont_prod_map`,
  `cont_swap`, and the universal property.

- `theory/Sums.v` (624 lines): The key insight is that a chain in
  `A + B` is *eventually stable* in one component (either all `inl` or
  all `inr` from some index onward), since the orderings do not mix
  constructors. The sup is the sup of the stable projection. This proof
  is constructive — no classical axioms needed.

  Note: `A + B` is *not* made a `PointedCPO` even when both `A` and `B`
  are pointed, because `inl ⊥` and `inr ⊥` are incomparable.

---

### Domain Equations (BKV §4)

**BKV describe:** Solving recursive domain equations `D ≅ F(D, D)` via
inverse limits of approximation sequences. They describe EP-pairs
(embedding-projection pairs), mixed-variance locally continuous
bifunctors, the approximation sequence `D₀, F(D₀,D₀), ...`, and the
bilimit construction. BKV note the concrete bifunctor `(A, B) ↦ [A →c B]⊥`
and the resulting recursive domain `D∞ ≅ [D∞ →c D∞]⊥`. The paper
follows A&J §5.2–5.3.

**rocq-domain-theory:**

- `theory/DomainEquations.v` (446 lines): Abstract framework.
  `IsMixedLocallyContinuous` HB mixin with 6 axiom fields.
  Approximation sequence, EP-pair lifting, `BilimitData` record.
  1 `Axiom` (`bilimit_exists`) — requires an omega-product CPO not yet
  constructed. All consequences (D∞, ROLL/UNROLL isomorphism, deflation
  chain) are fully proved from the record.

- `instances/FunLift.v` (298 lines): Concrete bifunctor
  `(A, B) ↦ [A →c B]⊥` registered as a `MixedLCFunctor` instance.

- `theory/EnrichedTheory.v` (706 lines): EP-pair infrastructure
  (`ep_pair`, `ep_id`, `ep_comp`, `ep_chain`) used by domain equations.

---

## PCF Language (BKV §3)

---

### Syntax (BKV §3)

**BKV describe:** An intrinsically typed call-by-value language (PCFv)
in Administrative Normal Form, with separate mutually inductive `Value`
and `Exp` types indexed by typing environment and type. Variables are
typed de Bruijn indices. Renamings are defined before substitutions
(McBride's technique). BKV discuss two approaches — an earlier extrinsic
attempt that was abandoned, and the final intrinsic design. BKV's paper
shows constructors prefixed with `T` (for "typed"): `TINT`, `TBOOL`,
`TVAR`, `TFIX`, `TPAIR`, `TVAL`, `TLET`, `TAPP`, `TFST`, `TSND`,
`TOP`, `TGT`, `TIF`.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `lang/PCF_Syntax.v` (804 lines) follows BKV's
final intrinsic design exactly. Changes are purely cosmetic naming:

| BKV paper (§3) | Our implementation | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `Ty := Int \| Bool \| Arrow \| Prod` | `Ty := Nat \| Bool \| Arrow \| Prod` | `Int` → `Nat` (values are `nat`, not `Z`) |
| `Arrow` notation `->` | `Arrow` notation `→ₜ` | Subscript avoids clash with Rocq `→` |
| `Prod` notation `*` | `Prod` notation `×ₜ` | Subscript avoids clash with Rocq `*` |
| `TINT n` | `NLIT n` | Dropped `T` prefix |
| `TBOOL b` | `BLIT b` | |
| `TVAR i` | `VAR v` | |
| `TFIX e` | `FIX τ₁ τ₂ body` | Explicit type indices in constructor |
| `TPAIR v1 v2` | `PAIR v1 v2` | |
| `TVAL v` | `VAL v` | |
| `TLET e1 e2` | `LET e1 e2` | |
| `TAPP f v` | `APP f v` | |
| `TFST`/`TSND v` | `FST`/`SND v` | |
| `TOP op v1 v2` | `OP op v1 v2` | |
| `TGT v1 v2` | `GT v1 v2` | |
| `TIF b e1 e2` | `IFB b e1 e2` | |
| `Subst Γ Γ'` | Same | Unchanged |
| `substVal`/`substExp` | `substVal`/`substExp` | Same names |
| `singleSubst`/`doubleSubst` | `single_subst`/`double_subst` | Snake_case |

**What we add beyond BKV:** The `var_case` combinator (see DD-013)
for definitionally-computing case analysis on de Bruijn variables,
avoiding `JMeq_eq` opacity. This ensures `single_subst v τ ZVAR ≡ v`
holds by kernel conversion.

---

### Operational Semantics (BKV §3)

**BKV describe:** A big-step evaluation relation
`Ev : CExp τ → CValue τ → Prop` (notation `e ⇓ v`) with 9 rules:
e_Val, e_Op, e_Gt, e_Fst, e_Snd, e_App, e_Let, e_IfTrue, e_IfFalse.
BKV note: "the operational semantics can be presented very directly"
with intrinsic typing. BKV use `ble_nat` for the greater-than
comparison and destructure `TFIX e` directly in the application rule.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `lang/PCF_Operational.v` (332 lines) has the
same 9 evaluation rules with cosmetic differences:

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `Ev` relation | `Eval` | Renamed |
| `ble_nat n2 n1` | `n₂ <? n₁` (`Nat.ltb`) | Stdlib modernization |
| `e_App` destructures `TFIX e` | `e_App` takes `FIX τ₁ τ₂ body` | More explicit pattern |

**What we add beyond BKV:**
- `Converges e := ∃ v, Eval e v` with `e ⇓` notation
- `eval_deterministic`: the evaluation relation is functional
- Inversion lemmas: `eval_let_inv`, `eval_app_fix_inv`, `eval_ifb_inv`

---

### Denotational Semantics (BKV §3.1)

**BKV describe:** Type interpretations `SemTy`, environment
interpretations `SemEnv`, and mutually recursive denotation functions
`SemVal`/`SemExp` defined by structural recursion on terms. Each case
is a point-free composition of library combinators. BKV use setoid
equality `==` and the coinductive lift monad. They describe a
substitution lemma (`SemCommutesWithSubst`) stating that denotation
commutes with syntactic substitution.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `lang/PCF_Denotational.v` (1167 lines) follows
the same point-free design:

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `SemTy`/`SemEnv` | `sem_ty`/`sem_env` | Snake_case |
| `SemVal`/`SemExp` | `sem_val`/`sem_exp` | |
| `SemSubst` | `sem_subst` | |
| `SemCommutesWithSubst` | `sem_val_subst` + `sem_exp_subst` | Split into two lemmas |
| `SimpleOp2 op` | `nat_binop op` | More descriptive name |
| `choose @3 (...)` (curried conditional) | `cont_ifb ∘ ⟨sem_val v, ⟨sem_exp e₁, sem_exp e₂⟩⟩` | Explicit pairing |
| `Kleislir` | `kleislir` | Same concept |
| `FIXP ∘ curry(curry(SemExp e))` | `FIXP ∘ flip(curry(flip(curry(sem_exp body))))` | Double flip for binding order |
| Setoid `==` | Leibniz `=` | See DD-004 |
| Coinductive `(SemTy τ)⊥` | `option (sem_ty τ)` | Flat lift |

**What we add beyond BKV:**

- **Renaming route** (see DD-012): The substitution lemma is proved via
  an explicit renaming chain: `sem_ren_ext` → `sem_val_ren`/`sem_exp_ren`
  → `sem_ren_wk` → `sem_val_wk` → `sem_subst_ext` → `sem_val_subst`/
  `sem_exp_subst`. BKV describe the bootstrapping strategy in prose but
  do not detail the proof structure.

- **Computation lemmas**: `sem_val_NLIT`, `sem_val_BLIT`, `sem_val_PAIR`,
  `sem_val_FIX_unfold`, `sem_exp_VAL`, `sem_exp_LET`, `sem_exp_APP`,
  `sem_exp_FST`, `sem_exp_SND`, `sem_exp_OP`, `sem_exp_GT`,
  `sem_exp_IFB`, `sem_exp_IFB_true`, `sem_exp_IFB_false`.

- **Notation**: `⟦v⟧ᵥ`, `⟦e⟧ₑ`, `⟦v⟧ᶜᵥ`, `⟦e⟧ᶜₑ` for denotation.

---

### Soundness (BKV §3.2)

**BKV describe:** The soundness theorem
`e ⇓ v → SemExp e == η ∘ SemVal v` (point-free, setoid equality).
The proof is by induction on the evaluation derivation.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `lang/PCF_Soundness.v` (261 lines).

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `SemExp e == η ∘ SemVal v` (point-free, setoid) | `sem_exp e tt = Some (sem_val v tt)` (pointwise, Leibniz) | Closed-term form |
| Stated for open terms | Stated for closed terms | Sufficient for adequacy |
| Induction on `Ev` | Induction on `Eval` | Same strategy |

**What we add beyond BKV:**
- `soundness_not_none`: convergence implies non-⊥ denotation
- `soundness_val`: values denote themselves
- `soundness_denotation_agree`: co-evaluating terms have equal denotations

---

### Adequacy (BKV §3.2)

**BKV describe:** The adequacy theorem
`SemExp e ≠ ⊥ → Converges e`. They describe the proof via a logical
relation (type-indexed family of relations between denotations and
syntactic terms) but note: "The proof is somewhat involved." BKV describe
the logical relation, the fundamental lemma by mutual induction on
syntax, and the derivation of adequacy as a corollary.

**rocq-domain-theory:** `lang/PCF_Adequacy.v` (820 lines) fully
formalizes the proof following BKV's described strategy.

| BKV description | Our implementation | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| `SemExp e ≠ ⊥` | `sem_exp e tt <> None` | Flat lift |
| `Converges e` | `e ⇓` := `∃ v, e ⇓ v` | |
| Logical relation described in prose | `rel_val`/`rel_exp` by `Fixpoint` on `Ty` | Fully formalized |
| Fundamental lemma | `fundamental_lemma` via `Combined Scheme val_exp_ind` | Mutual induction |
| FIX case "uses Scott induction" | `fixp_ind` applied with admissibility proof | |

**What we add beyond BKV:**

- `rel_val_admissible` / `rel_exp_admissible`: admissibility proofs by
  induction on `Ty`, using chain-stabilisation properties of the lift
  CPO and `eval_deterministic`.
- `rel_env`: environment relation (semantic environment related to
  syntactic substitution).
- `convergence_iff_defined`: the full correspondence
  `e ⇓ ↔ sem_exp e tt <> None`, combining soundness and adequacy.

**Key proof techniques:**
- FIX case uses `fixp_ind` with nested natural-number induction.
- Arrow case in `rel_val_admissible` uses `Eqdep.EqdepTheory.inj_pair2`
  to invert dependent pairs.
- Imports `Classical` for `excluded_middle` in chain case analysis.

## New Contributions Beyond BKV

The following components have no counterpart in BKV's paper.

---

### CPO-Enriched Categories

BKV implicitly use the fact that CPO is self-enriched (composition of
continuous functions is continuous). We make this explicit:

- `structures/Enriched.v` (378 lines): `CPOEnrichedCat` HB structure
  with hom-CPOs, continuous composition, locally continuous functors.
- `instances/Function.v` (436 lines): Registers `CPO.type` as a
  `CPOEnrichedCat` instance with `cont_fun` as hom-CPOs.
- `theory/EnrichedTheory.v` (706 lines): Joint continuity of
  composition, `lc_functor` record, EP-pair infrastructure.

---

### Natural Transformations and Yoneda

- `theory/NatTrans.v` (518 lines): Enriched natural transformations
  between locally continuous endofunctors. Pointwise order, chains,
  suprema — natural transformations form a CPO. Identity, vertical
  composition, left/right whiskering, interchange law.

- `instances/Yoneda.v` (443 lines): Representable functor `Hom(X,-)`,
  enriched Yoneda lemma with both directions and round-trip laws,
  packaged as an `ep_pair`.

Reference: Kelly (1982), Mac Lane (1998).

---

### Scott Topology

- `theory/ScottTopology.v` (~520 lines): Way-below relation `x ≪ y`,
  Scott-open sets, the Scott topology on CPOs, and basic properties.

Reference: A&J §2.2 - 2.3.

---

### Quantum Domain Theory

Not present in BKV. Based on KLM (2024):

- `quantum/QuantumStructure.v` (~340 lines): Involutive quantales,
  quantum posets, Kronecker delta.
- `quantum/qCPO.v` (~390 lines): Quantum chains, convergence, quantum
  CPO property, quantum Scott continuity.
- `quantum/qCPOProperties.v` (~1022 lines): Bundled continuous maps,
  category laws, cofinal subsequences, hom-set CPO-enrichment, quantum
  Kleene fixed-point theorem.

---

## Axiom Comparison

**BKV:** The paper describes all constructions but, being a paper, does
not distinguish between "proved" and "axiomatic" in the Coq sense.
The paper presents suprema for function spaces, sums, and the lift as
existing constructions without detailed proofs.

**rocq-domain-theory:** All domain-theoretic suprema are fully proved.

| Construction | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Function-space sup | Proved constructively (`theory/FunctionSpaces.v`) |
| Sum sup | Proved constructively (`theory/Sums.v`) |
| Lift sup | Proved via `ClassicalEpsilon` (`theory/Lift.v`) |
| Bilimit existence | `Axiom bilimit_exists` (requires omega-product CPO) |

**Classical axioms used:**
- `ClassicalEpsilon` in `Lift.v` (for `excluded_middle_informative` and
  `constructive_indefinite_description`)
- `Classical` in `PCF_Adequacy.v` and `ScottTopology.v`
- `ProofIrrelevance` in `Morphisms.v` (for `cont_comp_assoc`)
- `FunctionalExtensionality` in `PCF_Denotational.v` and
  `qCPOProperties.v`

**Admitted results:** `theory/LiftMonad.v` (supplementary coinductive
file only) has two admitted lemmas (`bisim_trans`, `converges_bisim`)
due to Rocq's productivity checker limitations. Neither is used
downstream. See DD-007.

## API Reference

### Naming Conventions

BKV use CamelCase and `T`-prefixed constructors. We use snake_case for
definitions and ALLCAPS for syntactic constructors (without the `T`
prefix).

## What We Preserve from BKV

The following design choices from BKV are adopted unchanged:

- **Intrinsic typing** for PCF: well-typedness by construction
- **ANF**: arguments to function calls must be values
- **Typed de Bruijn indices** via `Var Γ τ`
- **Renaming bootstrap**: renamings first, then substitutions
- **Big-step CBV evaluation** with 9 rules
- **Point-free denotational semantics**: each case is a composition of
  library combinators
- **Soundness by induction on evaluation**
- **Adequacy via logical relation** with fundamental lemma

- **`chain` as a record** (not an HB structure)
- **`mono_fun` as a record** with coercion to the underlying function
- **Separating strict from continuous**: strictness not always required
- **`c.[n]` notation** for chain access
- **Diagrammatic composition**: `g ∘ f` meaning "first f, then g"
